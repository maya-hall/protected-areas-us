While protected areas (PAs) are common throughout the globe, understanding their effectiveness and potential increase or decline is a perennial topic that touches on land management and use, biodiversity research, and human-nature dynamics. As part of a larger effort, this repository serves as a home base for my analyses and contributions. Contents include: 

<h2><strong>Land cover and land use product comparison</strong></h2>
This case study provides an overview comparison of products from the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) from the US Forest Service and the National Land Cover Database from the US Geological Survey.

<h2><strong>PAs by state comparison</strong></h2>
In the interest of identifying U.S. states and their associated PAs, I've produced a variety of tables comparing metrics such as total PA area and percent coverage of each state by PAs.
